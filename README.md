### Insert a parsed corpus in TigerSeach 
1. run:
	./runTRegistry.sh
2. click on CorporaDir in the left sidebar
3. from the toolbar choose: Corpus > Insert Corpus
4. import parsed corpus and choose "General Penn treebank format filter"
5. click Start

### Find matches for a syntactic pattern
1. run
	./runTSearch.sh 
2. click on the corpus in the left sidebar
3. write a query in the big white space and click Search
4. from the toolbar choose: Query > Export Matches to File > Export to file and Submit 


### Used Queries
**(q1)** to get the full corpus:

	[word=/.*/];

**(q2)** for the general VP-SBAR-S pattern without any constraints: 

	& #vp: [cat="VP"] 
	& #sbar: [cat="SBAR"]
	& #s: [cat="S"]
	& #vp > #sbar
	& #sbar > #s;

**(q3)** for the VP-SBAR-S pattern _with_ wh-adverb (WHADV), wh-noun (WHNP) or wh-propositional (WHPP) subordinate clause (SBAR):

	#vp & #sbar & #s 
	& #vp: [cat="VP"] 
	& #sbar: [cat="SBAR"]
	& #s: [cat="S"]
	& #wh: [cat=/WHNP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat = "WHNP" | cat="WHADJP" | cat=/WHADJP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat="WHADVP" | cat=/WHADVP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat="WHPP" | cat=/WHPP\-[0-9A-Z]/]
	& #vp > #sbar
	& #sbar > #s
	& #sbar > #wh;

**Filtered examples**: 

* WHNP: That selling of futures contract by elevators [is [what [helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harves]_S]_SBAR]_VP.
* WHADJP: But some analysts [wonder [how [strong the recovery will be]_S]_SBAR]_VP.
* WHADVP: Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound's weak state after Mr. Lawson's resignation and the yen's inability to [strengthen substantially [when [there are dollar retreats]_S]_SBAR]_VP.
* WHPP: He said, while dialogue is important, enough forums already [exist [in which [different intrests can express themselve]_S]_SBAR]_VP.

**(q4)** for the VP-SBAR-S pattern WITH "that" as the head of the SBAR clause we require that the SBAR has exactly 2 children; others are captured with:
	
	#vp & #sbar & #s 
	& #vp: [cat="VP"] 
	& #sbar: [cat="SBAR"]
	& #s: [cat="S"]
	& #sbar > #s
	& #sbar > [word="that"]
	& arity(#vp,3,100);

**A filtered example**

The FDA already requires drug manufactures to [include [warnings *ICH*]_NP [with [insulin products]_NP]_PP [that [symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products]_S]_SBAR. 

**(q5)** for the general VP-SBAR-S pattern we capture more relative clauses with this pattern: 

	#vp & #sbar1 & #s1 & #sbar2 & #s2 
	& #vp: [cat="VP"] 
	& #sbar1: [cat="SBAR"]
	& #sbar2: [cat="SBAR"]
	& #s1: [cat="S"]
	& #s2: [cat="S"]
	& #wh: [cat=/WHNP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat = "WHNP" | cat="WHADJP" | cat=/WHADJP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat="WHADVP" | cat=/WHADVP\-[0-9A-Z]/ | cat="WHPP" | cat=/WHPP\-[0-9A-Z]/]
	& #sbar1 > #wh
	& #sbar1 > #s1
	& #s1 > #vp
	& #vp > #sbar2
	& #sbar2 > #s2 

**Filtered example:***

Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring [[that]_WHNP [analysts [say [[may be the first step toward the bank's privatization]_S]_SBAR2]_VP]_S1]_SBAR1
